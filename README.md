# GoombaSend
This is a Gamecube/Wii homebrew application for sending GB/GBC roms to a GBA with a link cable.  
# Usage
All you need is a folder called "roms" on the root of your main device (SD Gecko on Gamecube and SD/USB on Wii) containing GB/GBC roms.  
After starting GoombaSend, you can select roms with the D-pad and A (or cancel selection with B) to transfer to your GBA in controller port 2.  
This project uses Goomba v2.30 as the Game Boy emulator.  
# Limitations
Please note that because this is all stored in the GBA RAM, the max file size including Goomba (42.4kb) is 256kb. 128kb (the max file size of a single GB game) is usable for rom transfer.  
Also, you won't be able to save whatsoever since this is all just temporary.
# Original Creator
GoombaSend was originally made by FIX94, I only updated it to allow support for multiple roms and easier menu controls.
